## Synopsis:

While Nepal may be a beacon of progress, legally recognizing an “other” gender, this film is breaking the silence on the daily struggle to gain not only social legitimacy, but also family acceptance, perhaps the largest hurdle for all of our personal journeys and dreams. The sole remaining son in her family, Meghna, from Jhapa, transitioned into her identity as a woman over the last decade.  As a model and businesswoman with big dreams, she shares an honest and thought-provoking look at her family and her life in Kathmandu –and an unusually poignant relationship between a mother and her daughter. Meghna Lama is a torchbearer for the transgender community in Nepal.  Bravely embracing her transformation in a culture that often values sons and daughters very differently, her dauntless attitude and spirited laugh are both a powerful reminder of not only what it is to be transgender in Nepal, but ultimately, what it is to be human.
